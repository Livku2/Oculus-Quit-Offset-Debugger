# Oculus-Quit-Offset-Debugger
Just if you want to disable the quit through hex editing, but the metadata is encrypted

It will just give you the offsets of both quit methods in the debug log

I do not want to add the source due to certain script kiddies

I'm not making an installer rn

\n

This is just a test so I know how to do it with everything else
